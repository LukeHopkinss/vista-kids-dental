        <p className="mt-3 text-slate-700">
          Most families with children rely on a pediatrician to be responsible for the health of their kids, and the
          same approach should be taken with dentistry. Pediatric dentists specialize in the oral healthcare of
          children and patients with special needs. Here are the answers to some frequently asked questions about
          pediatric dentists:
        </p>

        <h3 className="mt-6 text-lg font-semibold">What Does a Pediatric Dentist Do?</h3>
        <p className="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          A pediatric dentist is a dentist that after graduating from dental school completes an additional 2-3 years
          of education focused solely on the oral health of children and those with special needs. This additional
          schooling encompasses topics such as oral trauma, dental emergencies, sedation and general anesthesia, as
          well as managing cases with extensive dental needs. Furthermore, pediatric dentists train in the behavior
          management of pediatric patients, a critical skill needed to lower dental anxiety and, consequently, lower
          the chance of any long-term “dental trauma”.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          Pediatric dentists are professionals who have completed a specialized course of dentistry that caters to
          children who have special needs or otherwise need gentler care. The program consists of two to three years
          of further training after graduation from dental school. It includes hospital training, where they work
          with children who have more severe dental needs and emergencies, and training in numerous orthodontic
          teeth-straightening methods. Pediatric dentists work closely with pediatricians and general dentists, who
          refer select patients for this specialized dental treatment that requires this advanced training. The
          American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) is an organization of pediatric dentists, and its website
          has a good selection of brochures explaining their role in dentistry.
